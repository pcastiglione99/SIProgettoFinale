# Airline Booking System - Java Web Project ‚úàÔ∏è

This is a final project demonstrating a web application for an airline company, allowing users to search for flights and administrators to manage flight data. The application is built using Java and the Spring Boot framework.

## üìù Description

The system provides a web interface for:

1.  **Public Users:** Searching for available flights based on departure airport, arrival airport, date, and required baggage allowance. It displays available flights or informs the user if no suitable flights are found.
2.  **Administrators:** Logging into a secure area to manage flights, including adding new flights, modifying the aircraft assigned to existing flights, deleting flights, and viewing a report of future flights with booking details.

The application interacts with an on-premise-style SQL database.
